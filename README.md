# Lifelonglearning

Resources that inspire me to improve my data skills.
I have a running list of resources and generally sources of inspiration. 
Often times these are found via kindly sources tweeting lists and I eagerly c'n'p them into my Evernote or some place safe, like here.

Day-to-Day reading: 
Generally speaking, Medium https://medium.com/search?q=data has a great, active stream of info about all things data. 
Sign up to their daily newsletter and I promise you, you will be constantly inspired and motivated to improve your data game.

Conferences: 
I seem to miss out on loads, only seeing tweets from attendees when they are in the room... 
good thing is, it makes excellent blog posts like this appear. https://www.dataiq.co.uk/blog/be-change-you-want-see-lessons-women-data-2018
So be sure to search twitter for conference # afterwards too and if you are lucky enough to go to one, share your notes. 
I like adding mine to #sketchnote https://twitter.com/SketchnoteArmy


Courses, distance:
This is a super list of distance courses (mainly free that David Venturi [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@davidventuri]
has kindly evaluated and shared.) He made finding the most respected data courses his own personal data project. 
See once you start hunting for one you cannot stop finding them.

Udemy are good and this course for machine learning with R, really helped me.

Talking of R. Here is another someone-else's-list I am sharing.
