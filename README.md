# Lifelonglearning

Resources that inspire me to improve my data skills.
I have a running list of resources and generally sources of inspiration. 
Often times these are found via kindly sources tweeting lists and I eagerly c'n'p them into my Evernote or some place safe, like here.

Day-to-Day reading: 
Generally speaking, Medium https://medium.com/search?q=data has a great, active stream of info about all things data. 
Sign up to their daily newsletter and I promise you, you will be constantly inspired and motivated to improve your data game.

Conferences: 
I seem to miss out on loads, only seeing tweets from attendees when they are in the room... 
good thing is, it makes excellent blog posts like this appear. https://www.dataiq.co.uk/blog/be-change-you-want-see-lessons-women-data-2018
So be sure to search twitter for conference # afterwards too and if you are lucky enough to go to one, share your notes. 
I like adding mine to #sketchnote https://twitter.com/SketchnoteArmy

Weekly Data challenges: 
These are a good way to build up your confidence and learn from others. Winners are always very generous, sharing their work around/hacks and so it's always worth getting in contact. 
MakeOverMonday - TABLEAU https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/ as the name suggests a data set in put up on a Monday and you have until Wednesday to join that week's comp, but you can always use previous challenges to practice. 
Kaggle - owned by Google, they run regular competitions, the big prize is often a job as headhunters frequently trawl the site https://www.kaggle.com/challenge-yourself
DataKind - https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-uk data enthusiasts coming together to help social enterprises/charities to solve their problems.
London Data Store https://data.london.gov.uk/ -  not a weekly challenge as such but a collection of data the Mayor of LDN has opened up for analysis.

Courses, distance:
This is a super list of distance courses (mainly free that David Venturi [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@davidventuri]
has kindly evaluated and shared.) He made finding the most respected data courses his own personal data project. 
See once you start hunting for one you cannot stop finding them.

Udemy are good and this course for machine learning with R, really helped me. 
https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=SAyYsTvLiGQ&ranSiteID=SAyYsTvLiGQ-09Od5C_X321Zco340Z_i7g&siteID=SAyYsTvLiGQ-09Od5C_X321Zco340Z_i7g&LSNPUBID=SAyYsTvLiGQ

Talking of R. Here is another someone-else's-list I am sharing.
https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience btw Reddit is packed full of good pointers and directions.
